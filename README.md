~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The classic Pacman game simulated with a few modifications. The player controls Pac-Man through a 'maze' of various dots, known as   Pac-Dots or pellets. There are also four multi-colored ghosts: Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (blue), and Clyde (orange). In many   versions, each ghost has its own personality (which we chose to skip because it would require many more levels to truly see it),    however, we kept the 'ghost pen' in the middle the same. The goal of the game is to consume all the pellets in a level in order to   proceed to the next one (however, we chose to display a game won screen instead because during a demo we wouldn't be able to show     the levels and also time restraints). The four ghosts roam the 'maze', trying to catch Pacman. If any of the ghosts touch Pacman,     he  loses a life and the game 'resets' in the sense that the eaten pellets are still eaten and the score remains the same. The     'reset' is moving all characters back to original starting positions. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pacman is <br> awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by defaultâ€”DIP switches inside the machine (in arcades) can change the required points<br> to 15,000 or 20,000 ,or disable the bonus life altogether (we have disabled this for the time being).

IMPORTANT NOTES/ INSTRUCTIONS:
   -the map was already changed from 1024 x 1024 to 600 x 512, please have a screen that can support 600 x 512
   -cd Pacman/main and then run main.pde to start game
   -use arrow keys to move (have keyboard with arrow keys! or remap your keyboard, or use on screen keyboard)
   -'touch' will mean to click on screen (have a pointer device (eg mouse, touch pad, tablet) or remap a key to act like a one)
   -sometimes when first running the file, you may have to click on the processing screen in order for it to register movements

WORKING FEATURES / THINGS FOR MR. K TO TEST::
   -Player (Pacman)
    -Movement (cardinal directions)
    -Score
     -eating pellets add 200 to score
      -moving to a spot without a pellet or already eaten pellet won't increase score
     -eating ghosts will add a greater score than the eating the 'pellets' (specicially 500 points)
    -Power Up
     -Allow player to 'eat' ghosts
      -without this, player dies if in contact with ghost
   -Ghost AI
    -Multiple states
     -'chase' -- literally go after the player. note that the different paths can lead to an ambush/ cornering
     -'scatter' -- modern games are somewhat random movement, but generally they aim for a corner of the board (we mimicked the orginal)
     -'frightened' -- basically they can be eaten, turn blue-ish

UNRESOLVED BUGS / UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
   -Player (Pacman)
    -Player is slighly slower than ghosts, if ghosts revert to 'chase' nearby, they may overcome Pacman
    -if player is smart, he can outthink the AI and accurately predict movements to the extent of winning at 'chicken'
   -Ghosts
    -'frightened' Blinky looks weird
    -Ghosts' changes between states sometimes look un-natural, especially when they are in 'scattering'
    -Player can 'camp' near the 'ghost pen' if they were to eat a power up every so often (power ups last by time increments)
   -More maps!
   -Increasing layer lives (3/4 is already pretty overkill for one level)
